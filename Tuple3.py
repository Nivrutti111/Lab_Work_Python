#Q.3) Write a program to copy elements 44 and 55 from the following tuple into a new tuple.

#    for example Tuple1 elements are: (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

# Original tuple
tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

# Create a new tuple with elements 44 and 55
newtuple = (tuple1[3], tuple1[4])

# Print the new tuple
print("New Tuple with 44 and 55:", newtuple)
